# sub-matcher

A simple program that renames a subtitle to match the video name, and moves it to the same dir. I got tired
of doing this manually so I decided to make it a hobby project. Plus, it helps me to learn Clojure :)

## Installation

Download the standalone Java Archive (JAR) file from this repository. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is
required.

## Usage

The only acceptable input argument at the moment is a directory path to search for videos and subtitles.

    $ java -jar sub-matcher-0.1.0-standalone.jar [DIR]

The supported hierarchy is /dir/[VIDEO_FILE] /dir/[VIDEO_FILE]/[SUB_DIR]/[SUB_FILE], where:
* VIDEO_FILE ends with .avi, .mkv, mp4, .mpeg, or .mpg
* SUB_DIR can have any name
* SUB_FILE ends with .sub, .srt, or .txt

## Options

No options supported

## Examples

java -jar sub-matcher-0.1.0-standalone.jar /tmp

### Bugs

When there are > 1 subtitle files in SUB_DIR, the program fails. Need to decide what to do, maybe consider only
the first subtitle file.

### TODO

Add tests, preferably using spec
Add logging and a verbosity flag
Maybe add a minimal GUI
